#     1 = debug messages
#     2 = trace messages
#     3 = trace and all gearman related logs are going to stdout.

#servicegroups=name1,name2,name3

# Set this to 'no' if you want Mod-Gearman to only take care of
# servicechecks. No hostchecks will be processed by Mod-Gearman. Use
# this option to disable hostchecks and still have the possibility to
# use hostgroups for easy configuration of your services.
# If set to yes, you still have to define which hostchecks should be
# processed by either using 'hosts' or the 'hostgroups' option.
# Default is Yes.

# 'eventhandlers' queue or into the same queue like normal checks
# would do.

# enables or disables encryption. It is strongly
# advised to not disable encryption. Anybody will be
# able to inject packages to your worker.
# Encryption is enabled by default and you have to
# explicitly disable it.
# When using encryption, you will either have to
# specify a shared password with key=... or a
# keyfile with keyfile=...
# Default is On.
encryption=yes


# A shared password which will be used for
# encryption of data pakets. Should be at least 8
# bytes long. Maximum length is 32 characters.

# use_uniq_jobs
# Using uniq keys prevents the gearman queues from filling up when there
# is no worker. However, gearmand seems to have problems with the uniq

# when you run into problems with stuck jobs but make sure your worker
# are running.

# The queue_custom_variable can be used to define the target queue
# by a custom variable in addition to host/servicegroups. When set
# for ex. to 'WORKER' you then could define a '_WORKER' custom
# variable for your hosts and services to directly set the worker
# queue. The host queue is inherited unless overwritten
# by a service custom variable. Set the value of your custom
# variable to 'local' to bypass Mod-Gearman (Same behaviour as in
# localhostgroups/localservicegroups).
queue_custom_variable=WORKER

# Enable or disable result worker thread. The default is one, but
# you can set it to zero to disabled result workers, for example
# if you only want to export performance data.
# Default: 1
result_workers=1


# defines if the module should distribute perfdata
# to gearman.
# Note: processing of perfdata is not part of
# mod_gearman. You will need additional worker for
# handling performance data, like ex. pnp4nagios or nagflux.
# Performance data is just written to the gearman
# queue and not further processed.
# You can specify multiple queues by comma separated list.
# Default: no
perfdata=no

# Set perfdata_send_all=yes to submit all performance data
# of all hosts and services regardless of if they
# have 'process_performance_data' enabled or not.
# Default: no

# The Mod-Gearman NEB module will submit a fake result for orphaned host

# running.
# Default: yes

# 2 = CRITICAL
# 3 = UNKNOWN

# When accept_clear_results is enabled, the NEB module will accept unencrypted

# use of send_gearman/send_multi where you would have to spread the shared key to
# all clients using these tools.
# Default is no.
accept_clear_results=no

# When latency_flatten_window is enabled, the module reschedules host/service checks
# if their latency is more than one second. This value is the maximum delay in
# seconds applied to hosts/services. Set to 0 or less than 0 to disable rescheduling.
# Default is 30.
latency_flatten_window=30

# Use internal check_dummy which directly creates a check result instead of
# pushing the command to a worker. Only used if first file in command ends with /check_dummy
# and no shell special characters are used (except quotes)
