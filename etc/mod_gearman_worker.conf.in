# enables or disables encryption. It is strongly

# When embedded perl has been compiled in, you can use this

# restrict_path allows you to restrict this worker to only execute plugins
# from these particular folders. Can be used multiple times to specify more

# Workarounds

# workaround for rc 25 bug
# duplicate jobs from gearmand result in exit code 25 of plugins
# because they are executed twice and get killed because of using
# the same ressource.
# Sending results (when exit code is 25 ) will be skipped with this
# enabled.
