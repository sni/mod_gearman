# enables or disables encryption. It is strongly

# Use this option to disable an extra fork for each plugin execution. Disabling

# Default is yes (passive).

# When embedded perl has been compiled in, you can use this

# Default value used when the perl script does not have a

# Cache compiled perl scripts. This makes the worker process a little
# bit bigger but makes execution of perl scripts even faster.
# When turned off, Mod-Gearman will still use the embedded perl

# restrict_path allows you to restrict this worker to only execute plugins
# from these particular folders. Can be used multiple times to specify more

# Workarounds

# workaround for rc 25 bug
# duplicate jobs from gearmand result in exit code 25 of plugins
# because they are executed twice and get killed because of using
# the same ressource.
# Sending results (when exit code is 25 ) will be skipped with this
# enabled.
